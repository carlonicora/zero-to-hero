Welcome to Zero to Hero, a guide to become an immortal game master.

This is a **very opinionated** guide on how to be(come) an Immortal Game Master, whose campaigns will be told by bards in every city around the world. This guide is based on the way I run my own campaigns. It focuses on adventure prep, making it easy and engaging. It won't focus on any specific game, so no matter if you are running a Dungeons&Dragons or a Call of Cthulhu campaign, this guide can help you crafting better campaigns.

### Who is this guide for?
My style is neither railroading nor sandboxing, it is a healthy middle. Player agency is the most important driving factor, and it works well inside a plot, where the game master can plan a storyline, its pace and intensity. This style works well for GMs that are trying to run a story with focus on a specific narrative, running their own home-brew adventures.

If you believe in pure sandbox games, this guide is not for you, as its core is about plotting adventures and presenting them to your players (*which will, sooner or later, tear them to pieces*).

### The "R" word
If you associate the idea of plotting an adventure with the "R" word (Railroading) it is clear you don't know the difference between the two. You have two options: close this guide and be who you want to be, or read forward and allow me to change your mind.

A plot is an idea you, as a GM, have on what may happen during an adventure. The plot is built during the prep phase. Your idea is not the story your players will play from the beginning to the end, it is a blueprint. It's the player characters' actions that will determine the outcome of the story. In my book this is a sign of a good GM.

Railroading means not allowing player agency, forcing the player characters to play your plot no matter what. This happens during the game. In my book this is a sign of an inexperienced or bad GM. Don't get me wrong, it takes time to learn how to improv at the table, coming out with new ideas when your players shred your plot to pieces.

Associating the plot with a railroad is like saying that building a car is bad because some drivers won't respect the speed limits. Get over it.

### Step by step
This guide is divided in 5 steps. Each step helps you move forward in your journey as a GM. 
- In the [Basic](1. Basic.md), I will talk about **conflicts** and **plots**, and teach you how to plot an adventure or session in 10 minutes. That's enough to start telling better stories.
- The [[2. Expert|Expert]] section will dig deeper into how to identify a list of **scenes** for your plot. This will help you planning a more balance adventure.
- In the [[3. Companion|Companion]] part you will learn how to truly integrate **player characters' background** in the story and how to create more rounded **non-player characters** to give your adventure a better sense of depth.
- The [[4. Master|Master]] chapter is all about running your games and learn how to **improvise**. You will understand how to enjoy the thrill of your players breaking your plot and you throwing even better encounters at them.
- The last chapter makes you become an [[5. Immortal|Immortal]] GM, and learn how to create the perfect pacing form your games, both in the plotting phase as well as during the sessions.
